Counterfeit
===========

Note: Stochastic Computational Model of the Effects of Counterfeit Components using Stochastic Pi Machine (SPiM). SPiM is used to build the computational model and generate the data (csv file) and visualizaion of the data is done by the Python code. SPiM is developed by Microsoft Research and more information about SPiM can be found at http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/spim/. 

Steps Involved to Execute the Model

1. Install SPiM and Python.

2. Execute the counterfeit.spi in SPiM.

3. The output of the SPiM is a csv (comma-separated values) file.

4. Use counterfeit.py to visualize the SPiM generated csv file by typing the following command on the terminal:
    python counterfeit.py counterfeit.csv
